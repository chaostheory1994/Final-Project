/* Collision Struct*/
/* This struct is here to tell the map/cells how it will go about calculating collision.
 * We will use a very estimated colision that is usually used only to see if objects are
 * are close enough to check for more refined/expensive collision. For our game,
 * using only the first pass collision detection should be enough, especially if
 * the shapes are easy and supported.
 * The values in the struct are going to be used differently between methods.
 * All the methods are defined by the type variable. The macros right above this,
 * are the different types. box, sphere, cone, cylinder.
 * All these shapes are going to be treated like that are alligned with the world.
 * 
 * Box:
 *      pos will be defined as the center of one of the squares.
 *      value is going to be defined as the center of the other square.
 *      dist the size of the all the square's sides on both ends.
 * Sphere:
 *      pos is going to be the center of the sphere. 
 *      value is going to be unused in this method.
 *      dist is the radius of the sphere.
 * Cone:
 *      pos is going to be the point of the cone.
 *      value is going to be the direction of the cone.
 *      dist is going to be the degrees from each end of the cone.
 * Cylinder:
 *      pos is going to be the center of one of the circles at the end. pref bottom.
 *      value is going to be the center of the other end of the cylinder.
 *      dist is the radius of both circles.
